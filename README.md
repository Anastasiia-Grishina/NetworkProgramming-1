# Network Programming Course

## Introduction
This Network Programming assignment was completed as a part of course D7001D Network programming and distributed applications at Lulea University of Technologies during 2018-2019 studying year.
The course is a part of [PERCCOM Master Program](http://perccom.univ-lorraine.fr/).

## Aims & Objectives
The lab aims at introducing key network programming concepts and get hands-on experience in Java programming 

**Studying objectives**
- to implement a simple GUI
- to test characteristics of one- and multi-threaded servers
- to realize TCP server-client interaction 
- to test Simple Messaging Interface (SMI) using Wireshark
- to establish an SSL connection, generate and manage keypairs
- to use Amazon Web Services (AWS) for demonstration of the written code

## Tools
- Java Programming Language
- AWS Management Console

## Results
Available in the [report](https://github.com/Anastasiia-Grishina/Network_Programming-TCP_Servers/blob/master/Report.pdf) with screenshots and explanations


## Folders
- bin
A folder that contained compiled Java files
- src
  - javaprog
  
  A directory with test code and minimal student input, contains echo servers and SMI with security part
  - lab1part1 
  
  A directory dedicated to a simple GUI that runs a looping task
  - lab1part3
  
  A directory with realization of client-server communication in 2 versions. Versions 1 and 2 in the [report](https://github.com/Anastasiia-Grishina/Network_Programming-TCP_Servers/blob/master/Report%20Lab%202.pdf) are implemented with source code to be found in "tcp" and "tcpV2" subfolders
